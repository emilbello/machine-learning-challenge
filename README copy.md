# machine-learning-challenge
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system. In this challenge, I create a machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset to help process this data.
